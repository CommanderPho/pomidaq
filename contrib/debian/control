Description: Portable Miniscope Data Acquisition
 PoMiDAQ is a recording software for UCLA Miniscopes as well
 as a shared library, so Miniscope recording can be embedded
 into other programs and pipelines easily.
 .
 Recorded data is encoded with the FFV1 codec by default, to allow
 for smaller video files at the same quality.
